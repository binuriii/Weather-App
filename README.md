# Weather-App
This is a simple and interactive weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on the city entered by the user. The app displays the current temperature, city name, humidity, and wind speed, along with dynamic weather icons that change according to conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, misty, etc.). It also includes input validation to handle invalid city names gracefully. Designed with a modern UI using gradient backgrounds and responsive layout, this project is a great example of combining API integration with clean frontend design.
